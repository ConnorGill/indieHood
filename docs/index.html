            <h1>Welcome to indieHood</h1>
            <p>indieHood is the best way to connect yourself to a local music scene:
                <br>
            an app with the simple goal of connecting avid music lovers
            to smaller indie bands.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Goal Functionality</h2>
        <p>In here, we describe what our goals for functionality will be.</p>

        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>As of now, no platform exists that gives smaller artists and bands a
            way to advertise their performances.
        We are aiming to change that. </p>
        <p>With indieHood users can find local live shows that they would have
            otherwise never heard of.
        With indieHood artists can work to expand their fanbase and share their
            music with people who would have otherwise never heard it.</p>
        <p>indieHood is about exploring a local music scene, connecting music
            lovers, and helping out those smaller artists.</p>
